== [http://code.google.com/p/begui/  beGui] ==
   BeGUI (pronounced bee-gui) is an OpenGL-based user interface library. It is intended to provide the most common user interface components and a unifying environment for their deployment. However, it is not built as a complete framework, like MFC for example. Instead, it is meant to provide classes that can be taken individualy and thrown into an already existing project to provide GUI functionality. This means that its design is decentralized, and it does not define or need any specific program organization. It provides, however, some optional foundation classes for faster application development.
